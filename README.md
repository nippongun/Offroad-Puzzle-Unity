# Offroad Puzzle Game 

## Overview:
This game has been written with the new (still experimental) Unity 6 engine. 
The goal is create an open world puzzle game (like The Witness) where the player uses their offroad capable vehicle to travel to places and solve puzzles.

So far I have implmented a 3rd Person Shooter Controller with Unity's Rigging. Animations and Models are from Maximo. 
Additionally, I have been implementing a Car Controller based on real input values (the 3 vectors i.e., suspension, drift and acceleration).
Also, the game includes the first steps for a puzzle system. 

Note: I kept the repository local and private, initially.
